# Quick start

## Starting with NimbusImage is easy—help is here!

{% hint style="info" %}
At the top right is a help icon (?) and a chatbot icon. The help icon has user tours to guide you through basic tasks, and the chatbot can help you look at your images and come up with some analysis strategies, along with instructions for using NimbusImage.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Press <mark style="background-color:orange;">**tab**</mark> anywhere in the interface to bring up a cheat sheet of commands and keyboard shortcuts.
{% endhint %}

## Sign up

We strongly recommend you start by trying NimbusImage from an existing server like [nimbusimage.com](https://app.nimbusimage.com/)—no installation required! Just follow the sign up instructions. There are a number of plans on there to help support the ongoing development of NimbusImage, and a free tier that you can use for small datasets and occasional use.

{% hint style="info" %}
Group plans are available for teams! First the administrator should sign up, then the administrator can invite others to the team plan. If you want to add existing members to your team, contact support@cytopixel.com.
{% endhint %}

## Drop in your data into the file drop zone

You can drag and drop your data directly onto the drop zone to load it into NimbusImage:

<div align="left"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

That brings up this dialog:

<div align="left"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

## View your data

The image viewer should be pretty intuitive to navigate. Press `tab` to reveal some keyboard shortcuts and features.

## Find some objects

Click `+` next to "Toolset" to bring up a menu. You can customize your own interface!

For instance, make a blob tool and draw some blobs like this:

## Analyze those objects

Click "Object List" to bring up the object panel:

Then click on "Measure Objects" to bring up the measurement panel:

Then click "Create Property" to create and compute the property, and check the value (here, Area) in the list below:

## Make a Snapshot

**Use Snapshots** to take a visual bookmark of your data to capture and document that perfect picture for your paper or talk.

Use Snapshots to take a visual bookmark of your data to capture and document that perfect picture for your paper or talk.
