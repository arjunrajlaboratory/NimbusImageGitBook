# Citations

NimbusImage depends on countless contributions from scientists and engineers around the world. If you use NimbusImage, we recommend you cite the relevant papers to recognize these efforts. We also hope to publish a paper soon that you can cite for the use of NimbusImage itself.

## How to acknowledge NimbusImage and related software

We recommend including text along the following lines in your papers:

> We analyzed our image datasets using the NimbusImage platform, which is available here:\
> [https://github.com/arjunrajlaboratory/NimbusImage/](https://github.com/arjunrajlaboratory/NimbusImage/)\

>
> We used the Cellpose and Cellpose retrain tools (1-3) to detect cells and the Piscis and Piscis retrain tools (4) to detect mRNA spots. We connected each mRNA spot to the nearest cell using the "Connect to nearest tool" as described in the NimbusImage documentation.

### Cellpose

Cellpose works like magic for cell segmentation and is the product of extensive research and development by Carsen Stringer. They have a series of three papers on the topic, and we generally recommending citing all three. The first one describes the Cellpose algorithm, the second introduces retraining, and the third introduces image restoration and new, highly accurate models.

### StarDist

StarDist is a powerful tool for cell and nuclei detection that uses star-convex polygons to accurately segment objects in microscopy images. It is particularly effective for nuclear segmentation and can work in both 2D and 3D.

### Segment Anything Model (SAM)

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a revolutionary promptable segmentation tool developed by Meta Research that can segment almost any object in an image based on simple prompts like points or boxes. NimbusImage incorporates SAM to enable rapid semi-automated segmentation with minimal user input.

### Piscis

Piscis is a specialized deep learning algorithm developed by Will Niu while in the Raj Lab. It is designed specifically for detecting diffraction-limited spots in fluorescence microscopy images, such as single RNA molecules in FISH experiments. It uses a novel loss function, the SmoothF1 loss, that directly penalizes false positives and false negatives while remaining differentiable for deep learning training.
