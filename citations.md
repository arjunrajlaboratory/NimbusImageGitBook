# Citations

NimbusImage depends on countless contributions from scientists and engineers around the world. If you use NimbusImage, we recommend you cite the relevant papers to recognize these efforts. We also hope to publish a paper soon that you can cite for the use of NimbusImage itself.

## How to acknowledge NimbusImage and related software

We recommend including text along the following lines in your papers:

> We analyzed our image datasets using the NimbusImage platform, which is available here:\

> We used the Cellpose and Cellpose retrain tools (1-3) to detect cells and the Piscis and Piscis retrain tools (4) to detect mRNA spots. We connected each mRNA spot to the nearest cell using the "Connect to nearest tool" as described in the NimbusImage documentation.

### Cellpose

Cellpose works like magic for cell segmentation and is the product of extensive research and development by Carsen Stringer. They have a series of three papers on the topic, and we generally recommending citing all three. The first one describes the Cellpose algorithm, the second introduces retraining, and the third introduces image restoration and new, highly accurate models.
