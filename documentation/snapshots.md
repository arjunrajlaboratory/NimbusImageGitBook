# Snapshots

Snapshots serve a few purposes:

1. Bookmark a location in your dataset to facilitate sharing.
2. Download images of specific regions for publication purposes.
3. Download movies from your dataset to make it easy to share these with people.

## Making a Snapshot

Making a snapshot is easy. Just open the Snapshot pane by clicking here.

Drag the red rectangle to cover the area of interest. The pixel-precise location area are also given in numerical fields, so you can make it precisely the size you would like. A couple convenience functions are there:

1. **Set frame to current viewport.** If you've zoomed into a place you like, then click this button and the frame of the Snapshot will be set to precisely the region you zoomed to.
2. **Set frame to maximum.** This button will reset the frame to contain the entire image in the view.

## Downloading images

There are multiple ways in which you can download Snapshot images for use in a publication or presentation.

**Scaled layers vs Raw channels.** You can either download contrasted images or raw pixel value images. Note that all contrasts are linear and hence allowed by most major journals.

**Layer download options.** There are several ways you can download your images:

1. _All layers._ Gives you an image file for each layer separately.
2. _Composite layers._ Gives you a composite image with all layers merged together, matching what is on screen
3. _Individual layers._ Allows you to download an image just for the specific layer selected.

Click "Download images" to download the images.

**Download screenshot of current viewport** allows you to download a "screenshot", which includes all annotations and the scale bar.
