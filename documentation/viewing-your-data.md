# Viewing your data

Once your data is loaded into NimbusImage, you will interact with it through the viewer. The viewer allows for easy navigation and flexible visualization.

**Key features include:**

* **Easy to use navigation and contrast settings**
* **"Unrolling" of variables** to show montages
*   **Overview "minimap".** Drag around the square to navigate; shift-click-drag to directly go to a location.

* **Dynamic scale bar.** Click the scale bar to adjust pixel sizes and other settings.
* **Zoom in and out of large images.** Scroll wheel zooms, just like Google Maps.
* **Flexible layer settings.** See below for more information about layers.

## Layers

Understanding layers can help unlock more flexibility in how you visualize your data. Generally, layers are most commonly thought of as mapping to channels, but in NimbusImage, they are capable of more. For instance, you can make multiple layers that draw from the same channel, but show different times in different colors, which can be very helpful for time lapse analysis.

### Layer grouping

Another useful feature is layer grouping, which allows you to put together multiple layers into a single grouped layer. For instance, if you have a couple fluorescence channels that you always want to show together, you can group them.

To use this feature, just drag the layers to a "drop zone" to combine:![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)

You can add multiple layers to the group. Drag layers out of the group to undo the grouping.
