# Importing and exporting data

NimbusImage provides flexible options for exporting your analysis data, allowing you to perform additional analysis in external tools, back up your work, or transfer annotations between datasets. This section covers the different export formats and options available.

## Exporting data for analysis

After completing your image analysis in NimbusImage, you can export your data in two primary formats:

1. **CSV format** - For spreadsheet analysis in tools like Excel, R, or Python
2. **JSON format** - For complete data backup or transfer between datasets

### Exporting properties as CSV

CSV export is ideal for statistical analysis and data visualization in external tools:

1. Open the Annotation List
2. Click "MORE ACTIONS" 
3. Select "Export CSV"
4. Configure your export options:
   - **Property Export Options**: Choose to export all properties, only listed properties, or select specific properties
   - **Undefined Value Handling**: Decide how to represent missing values (Empty string, NA, or NaN)
5. Review the preview of columns that will be included
6. Enter a filename
7. Click "DOWNLOAD"

The resulting CSV file contains:
- Object identifiers and metadata (Id, Channel, XYZ coordinates, Time)
- Object tags and attributes
- All selected property values

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend using the empty string option for undefined values, because it is generally recognized by most analysis software.
{% endhint %}

### Exporting complete annotation data as JSON

The JSON export provides a comprehensive record of all annotation data:

1. Open the Annotation List
2. Click "MORE ACTIONS"
3. Select "Export JSON"
4. Choose what to include:
   - Export annotations (objects)
   - Export annotation connections
   - Export properties
   - Export property values
5. Enter a filename
6. Click "EXPORT SELECTED ITEMS"

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>The JSON export dialog lets you select exactly which components of your analysis to include</p></figcaption></figure>

The exported JSON file contains:
- Complete geometric data for all annotations (coordinates, shapes, colors)
- All connection information between objects
- Property definitions and calculated values
- Metadata about the dataset

{% hint style="info" %}
JSON export is particularly valuable for:
- Creating a complete backup of your analysis
- Transferring annotations between compatible datasets
- Advanced programmatic analysis using the complete data structure
- Archiving analysis results alongside raw data
{% endhint %}

## Importing annotation data

NimbusImage allows you to import previously exported JSON files, making it possible to:

1. Restore annotations from backups
2. Transfer annotations between compatible datasets
3. Share analysis with collaborators

To import annotation data:

1. Navigate to the dataset where you want to import annotations
2. Click "MORE ACTIONS" in the Annotation List
3. Select "Import JSON"
4. Select your JSON file
5. Review the import options
6. Click "IMPORT"

{% hint style="warning" %}
When importing annotations, be aware that:
- The target dataset should have a compatible structure with the source dataset
- Importing will not overwrite existing annotations unless explicitly configured to do so
- For time-lapse datasets, ensure the time points in the imported data match the structure of your target dataset
{% endhint %}

## Data ownership and transparency

NimbusImage's export capabilities ensure that you maintain complete ownership of your analysis data. By supporting standard formats like CSV and comprehensive JSON exports, you can:

- Perform advanced analysis in your preferred tools
- Maintain complete backups of your work
- Share results transparently with collaborators
- Integrate NimbusImage analysis into broader workflows
- Create reproducible analysis pipelines

The combination of interactive analysis within NimbusImage and flexible data export options provides a powerful workflow that respects scientific integrity while maintaining ease of use.
