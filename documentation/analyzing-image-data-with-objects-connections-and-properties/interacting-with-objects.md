# Interacting with objects

One of the main advantages of working in NimbusImage is that you can interact with your objects. You can remove bad objects by quickly selecting and deleting. You can add new ones with the same tag to fix pipeline errors.&#x20;

Current frame only means you only show the objects in the current frame in the object list.

There are various filtering options. You can visually filter by the values of a property, like area. You can filter by annotation IDs, allowing you to find specific annotations from your analysis. You can also just circle a region to select just those annotations.

Usually annotations will show regardless of whether their layer is hidden or not, but you can switch that behavior.

You can show or hide different things as shown. You can sort by properties. Also, click on the list and it will move to that annotation in the dataset. You can also add properties to the list using this properties dropdown:
